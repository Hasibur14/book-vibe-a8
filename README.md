# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Five bullet points features and characteristics:
1.React-based frontend framework
2.Utilization of React Router for client-side routing
3.Integration of external data through fetch API
4.Implementation of dynamic sorting options for book lists
5.Usage of PropTypes for type checking in components
